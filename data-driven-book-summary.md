# Data Driven by DJ Patil & Hilary Mason - Notes
Data science is not fundamentally new. What's innovative is how it combines several different fields and skills in a single professional. The first of these is mathematics, with an emphasis on statistics and linear algebra. The second is computer science, including programming and infrastructure design. It's essential to be able to extract data from a database and into an analysis package and back again. Finally, a data scientist *must* be able to communicate effectively and create coherent narratives around their work. Insights that are not actionable are next to useless. Asking the right questions, domain expertise, a keen ability to see the problem, and empathy to join it all (a concept so often neglected) are all of paramount importance.

Data scientists should never be isolated from business areas and decision makers. Companies and governments are increasingly aware of the need for "a Spock on the bridge".

Just acquiring and processing is not the whole story. Data quality is crucial. Data must be organized, consistently formatted, well-documented and, as much as possible, error-free. Cleaning data is often 80% of the job.

Many organizations invest heavily in data processing without a clear goal, resulting in large expenditures to create and maintain a vault of data that ends up being rarely used. Successful organizations don't expect that people will create value from a large store of data just because it's available. *They put their data to use*, to understand their customers and their business, to develop experiments and test hypotheses that improve their processes, and to build new products.

## Democratizing Data

[...] To help employees make the best use of data, a new role has emerged: the data steward. *The steward's mandate is to ensure consistency and quality of the data by investing in tooling and processes that make the cost of working with data scale logarithmically while the data itself scales exponentially*.

## Managing Research
Diving into a new data set is not just a matter of checking off statistics, but of developing an intuition for any possible flaws in the data, any unexpected things it might explain, and building a mental model of what it says about the world. After this initial approach and the definition of the problems to be tackled, a robust process for managing research is needed. Without it, you risk wasting time and effort on unimportant issues or getting drawn into the engineering side of things, where research is not a priority.

**A loose framework for tackling data science problems:**

 1. ***What is the question we are asking?*** Companies have diverse teams, so make sure to state the question in a way everyone can understand and see why it might be relevant and useful.
 2. ***How do we know when we've won?*** You need to define the metrics by which you will evaluate your answer, be they quantitative or qualitative, and everyone must be on the same page about what a successful outcome looks like.
 3. ***Assuming we solve this problem perfectly, what will we build first?*** This is intended to clarify the solution's potential to impact your business. After defining the first thing, it's good to come up with more and look for both short- and long-term value.
 4. ***If everyone in the world uses this, what is the impact?*** Reinforcing once more the relevance criterion, resources should only be invested in projects that will have a significant impact on business.
 5. ***What's the most evil thing that can be done with this?*** This works on two fronts. Your colleagues are probably *not* evil. But imagining what would happen *if you abandon all constraints* can help to think outside the proverbial box. Secondly, good and lawful people generally don't see the potential uses a tool can have for evil. Scientists are often making ethical decisions, even if inadvertently. Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean you *should*. When uncertain, refer to experts on privacy and legal matters, such as the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) and [The Center for Internet and Society](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/).
