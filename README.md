# data-science-book-summaries
A collection of data science book summaries.

This is intended as an efficient way to condense and review some relevant books for working with data. Hopefully they will be of use to others as well.

[Data Driven by DJ Patil & Hilary Mason](https://github.com/Frentan/data-science-book-summaries/blob/master/data-driven-book-summary.md) - A neat little book that outlines the skills needed for a data scientist, frameworks for managing research and processes, and the steps to make a data-driven organization.
